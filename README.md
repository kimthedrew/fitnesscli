Python CLI Application

Overview

This Python CLI application is designed to address a real-world problem by providing an intuitive, text-based interface for users. It leverages best practices in software development and a robust data management system with SQLAlchemy ORM. The application is packaged and structured for maintainability, ensuring clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Features

Command-Line Interface (CLI): A user-friendly CLI for seamless interaction.

Data Management: Built with SQLAlchemy ORM to handle data across three or more related tables.

Virtual Environment: Uses Pipenv to manage dependencies, ensuring a clean and isolated environment.

Modular Design: Follows Python's best practices with a proper package structure.

Efficient Data Structures: Incorporates lists, dictionaries, and tuples for optimal performance.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

Pipenv (to manage the virtual environment and dependencies)

Installation

Clone the repository

Set up the virtual environment

Activate the virtual environment

Run the application:

python main.py

Configuration

Update the config.py file to set database configurations and other application-specific settings.

Usage

The CLI provides the following commands:

add: Add new entries to the database.

list: Display data from the database.

update: Modify existing data.

delete: Remove entries from the database.

help: Get a list of available commands.

Example:

python main.py add --name "John Doe" --email "john.doe@example.com"
python main.py list

Database Structure

The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM to manage a relational database with the following tables:

Users: Stores user information (e.g., name, email).

Projects: Contains details about various projects.

Tasks: Tracks tasks associated with projects and users.

These tables are interconnected, ensuring seamless relationships and data integrity.

Development Guidelines

Follow the PEP 8 coding standards.

Write modular and reusable code.

Ensure all dependencies are listed in the Pipfile.

Test thoroughly before pushing changes.
